An exhibition by Department of Decentralization and Refraction

In the history of media, sound, and related image-based practices, hardly any city in the world has been as impactful in the concept of collaborative performance and presentation as a genre and medium as Berlin. From the early hacklabs, cross-sound performances, Bring-Your-Own-Beamer initiatives, and crypto raves, the sense of a joint collaboration has been at the core, inviting artists of many disciplines and genres to create, exhibit and perform together, creating novel social sculptural movements.

It is in this ethos Department of Decentralization Refraction, in collaboration with Refraction, presents ‘co-create’. The exhibition asks questions in and around identity, open source technology, and participatory frameworks as they relate to contemporary on-chain discourse. The work is presented on-chain and IRL, creating a new mode of action and communication, bridging the exhibition space in Berlin and on the blockchain, furthering the notion of presentation as participation.

The IRL exhibition is inspired by the Bring-Your-Own-Beamer (BYOB) initiative and asks presenting artists to consider and bring the device on which they believe the work is best suited for.
The BYOB concept was initiated by Rafaël Rozendaal.
