Gamers welcome! Connect to like-minded enthusiasts from Berlin's creative
Web3-, Metaverse, AI, and Blockchain scene! For years, the Web3 space
discussed how Blockchain could support gaming, and how the gaming industry
could make use of AI, XR (Extended Reality), and the Metaverses. Slowly,
the games industry adopted Web3 and AI technologies, and Apple launched
Vision Pro. We will discuss the latest trends with industrie insiders and
take a look at the future of AI and XR in games, and games in the
Metaverses.
Our speakers:
+ Nicola Mizon, founder, VIZTA Digital
+ Florian Dreschner, CTO, VOYA Games
+ Prof. Dr. Malte Behrmann, lawyer, former speaker of German Games
Association
